# dynamic-modules
This is an initial release of my dyamic-modules functionality originally released on my blog. 
The post was called [Modular Node.JS Application Programming](https://kylehayhurst.com/modular-node-js-application-programming/).

The examples are just for to show the use of the library loading functionality. Each sub-module could have been programmed
the same way but I was looking for some feedback on what people thought. Follow best practice, or code readability. 

Leave a comment on my blog of your thoughts!
